ðŸ”‘ A quick walkthrough on using JSON Web Tokens in Node for authentication.

â›‘ Work in Progress â›‘



JSON Web Tokens

Create a JWT and pass it to the client:
```
import jwt from 'jsonwebtoken'

const userData = {
  'name': 'John Doe',
  'userId': '12345',
  'favoriteFood': 'Marshmellow Creme'
}

function prepareJWTForBrowser (data) {
  let token = jwt.sign({
    userData
  }, process.env.JWT_SECRET, { expiresIn: '24h' })
  return token
}

prepareJWTForBrowser(userData)

```


Decode a JWT that's passed from the client:

```
import jwt from 'jsonwebtoken'

function decodeJWT (token) {
  // NOTE: jwt.verify() fails if you pass it null or undefined, so this is necessary
  if (!token) return false
  let decoded = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET)
  return decoded
}

decodeJWT()

```

What's a JWT secret? It's any string, really. You must use the same string to encode and decote your JWTs.

I recommend going into a terminal and generating a 256 bit string, like this (Node must be installed):

```
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(256).toString('base64'));"
```

Then copy and paste the output and put it into your environment variable.


## Security Notes

#### The Secret Should be Secret (and Long/Random)
It's very import that you don't share, commit, or expose your JWT secret in client side code. A decoded JWT can be used by an attacked to gain access to your system.

#### The Data You Encode is Visisble to EVERYONE
The user data that you encode into the JWT is actually NOT private. You do NOT need your JWT secret to access it. For proof, paste your encoded JWT (the output of `prepareJWTForBrowser` above), into this: https://jwt.io/.

That said, you should never store sensitive information inside it. It's simply used to match the authorized user to some data you can use to identify them.
